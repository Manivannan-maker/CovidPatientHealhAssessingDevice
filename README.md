# CovidPatientHealhAssessingDevice
 A medical device which will have  SpO2 , respiratory rate , heart rate , body temperature and on the top it will run by TinyML model using Edge impulse to predicts the patient condition. The classification is based on research papers.
 
 healthdata_Dataacquisition.ino --> code simulation in model training in edge impulse
 
 CovidPatientHealthAssessment.ino -> Code to flash for prorotype .
 
 Make sure you have incuded the 'ei-covid-19-patient-health-prediction-arduino-1.0.1.zip' library in arduino.
